Deep learning-driven action recognition is the next frontier for AI. Build it with us.
Drishti’s mission is to “extend human potential in an increasingly automated world”. For the first time since Henry Ford, we’re making manual processes visible to factory analytics—by creating manufacturing’s first and only solution for deep learning-driven action recognition.
About this role
A key part of Drishti is looking at mix of factory data and generating domain specific reports and analytics for the clients. A data analyst will understand the manufacturing domain and client context, and work with a mix of data from different sources, and create relevant reports.
Minimum Qualification
Ability to look at & analyse data using a set of tools – including excel, and python-based stack such as Pandas, R, and other tools
2+ years of experience with data analytics across domains – either inhouse in data team of a product company or with services organization
Prior experience with data ETL pipelines, setting them on snowflake / redshift / any other stack
Strong database concepts, including data modeling, SQL schema design & SQL queries
Experience with NoSQL / Mongo databases
1+ years of experience in Python
Bachelors in Computer Science / EE / Maths
Ability to pick up application of data in different domains
Understanding of concepts around time series, clustering, classification

Requirements:

Preferred Qualification
Certificate or courses done on data analytics on coursera, edX or others
Experience in manufacturing or applied context is a bonus
Five reasons to work at Drishti
Work with visionaries who can execute: Our leadership team is comprised of heavy hitters from the AI and deep learning world. Check out their patents and publications, and see how their histories intertwine with the biggest movements in the last 30 years of technology. And imagine being on a first-name basis with them, solving hard technical problems side-by-side.
Tackle a massive market challenge: Manufacturing is a $12T industry that still uses 100-year-old techniques to gather data on human tasks. Which means that people, who still perform nearly 75 percent of factory activities, are effectively invisible to analytics. This situation severely hinders the decision-making abilities of the world’s largest manufacturing brands. The demand for a solution couldn’t be larger.
Do what you love – solve problems using tech: A problem of this magnitude requires the full force of technological solutions. You’ll take on neural network model accuracy, high-volume video transit and storage, Big Data analysis and much more. It’s the challenge – and the madness, and the fun – of building an SAP on top of a YouTube on top of a Nest.
Lead the charge from Bangalore: Drishti is series B funded Silicon Valley-based startup and funded by top venture capital investors that include Andreessen Horowitz, Emergence Capital, BGV, Sozo Ventures, Toyota AI Ventures etc. But – and this is critical for you – Drishti is building its product out of Bangalore. From our CTO on down, Bangalore is the heart and soul of Drishti’s engineering. You’ll be at the centre of the action.
Get exposure to deep learning: Deep learning technology is fundamental to what we do, and select engineers at Drishti have the opportunity to rotate into our deep learning group, to work alongside some of the foremost experts in the field.",20:12:31,02/01/2021

In one or more such cases, false promises of actual or potential selection, or initiation or completion of the recruitment formalities appear to have been or are being made. Some jobseekers appear to have been asked to pay money to specified bank accounts of individuals or entities as a condition of their selection for a ‘job’ with Deloitte. These individuals or entities are in no way connected with Deloitte and do not represent or otherwise act on behalf of Deloitte.

We consider candidates only on merit and that we provide an equal opportunity to eligible applicants.
No one other than an authorised official of Deloitte is permitted to confirm any job offer from Deloitte.
Anyone who at any time has made or makes any payment to any party against promises of job or selection for a job with Deloitte or any matter related to this (including those for ‘registration’, ‘verification’ or ‘security deposit’) or otherwise engages with any such person who has made or makes fraudulent promises or offers, does so (or has done so) entirely at their own risk. Deloitte takes no responsibility or liability for any such unauthorised or fraudulent actions or engagements.
We encourage jobseekers to exercise caution. If you have queries about the veracity of a job offer you have received which relates to Deloitte or would like to report a fraud with regard to job offers with Deloitte, please send an email to inhiringalert@deloitte.com
